OUTPUT - Exercise 5: Difference between JPA, Hibernate and Spring Data JPA
-----------------------------------------------

âœ… JPA vs Hibernate vs Spring Data JPA: Demo Output

--- Hibernate Demo ---
Hibernate: insert into employee (name, salary) values (?, ?)
Hibernate transaction committed.
Employee added successfully using Hibernate.
Generated Employee ID: 1

--- Spring Data JPA Demo ---
Spring Boot application started...
EmployeeRepository.save(employee) invoked
Employee saved successfully using Spring Data JPA.
Generated Employee ID: 2

--- Logging from application.properties ---
DEBUG: org.hibernate.SQL - insert into employee (name, salary) values (?, ?)
DEBUG: com.example.EmployeeService - Saving employee using Spring Data JPA...

--- Notes ---
- Hibernate handled transaction manually using Session & Transaction.
- Spring Data JPA auto-managed transaction with @Transactional annotation.
- Spring Boot reduced boilerplate using Spring Data's JpaRepository.
